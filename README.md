### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a qualified lawyer, building my tech stack and experience before making the move into a programming career. 

I am working through an intensive coding bootcamp run by HyperionDev, expecting to graduate in March 2023. 

I have uploaded the various capstone projects I have completed throughout the course to my profile, to show what I have learned.
